Word Count Calculator is an application that saves you time by counting out the words you type automatically. This will also save you a lot of time if you’re in college, high school or elsewhere that requires a specific amount of words in a document or an essay that you must complete.

Word Count Calculator was originally designed for my fiancee, LaTricia Simpson; and later we decided that it would be a great idea to release it to the general public. It has saved her many hours over all with writing essays and other documents that she wanted to keep short and simple.

This software is currently in early stages of development, and will be released shortly. The current in-house version is at 1.0.5, and is currently being tested for compatibility, features, and functionality.
