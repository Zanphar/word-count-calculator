Word Count Calculator is an application that saves you time by counting out the words you type automatically. This will also save you a lot of time if youâ€™re in college, high school or elsewhere that requires a specific amount of words in a document or an essay that you must complete.

**UPDATE 12/06/2012: I started to work on Word Count Calculator again, removing code that was either useless, out dated, and using more modern code, along with the implementation of new options. This is being done off the 1.0.6 code, and I am also moving away from Windows XP support completely.**

Word Count Calculator was originally designed for my fiancee, LaTricia Simpson, and later we decided that it would be a great idea to release it to the general public. It has saved her many hours over all with writing essays and other documents that she wanted to keep short and simple.

You can now download Word Count Calculator from SVN if you're familiar with the protocol. Please be advised that 1.0.5 and earlier are not available through SVN. SVN supports the 1.0.6 release and newer releases, and be advised that MD5 hash values are not available for the SVN releases of Word Count Calculator.
